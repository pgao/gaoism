                <p>I'm one of the workshop officers for Hackers@Berkeley, and this is the first workshop we had in 2012.  We made a ghetto version of Instagram with filters that could be controlled via an Arduino ultrasound sensor.</p>

                <p>Built for a <a href="http://www.hackersatberkeley.com/">Hackers@Berkeley</a> hackathon in November 2011.  My friends and I made a browser-based RPG game on top of web.py, which consisted of players participating in hackathons to earn money, items, and eventually develop their skill to godlike (Ranking: Donald Knuth) proportions.  It was previously available <a href="http://www.hackception.com">here</a>, but the web site has since been retasked to other projects.</p>

                <p>120 lb semi-autonomous robot built for FIRST Robotics competition.  Features a dextrous timing-belt driven telescoping arm used to pick and place inner tubes onto 10 foot tall pegs and a novel minibot that utilises neodymium magnets to climb a 6-foot tall steel pole.  Won the BAE Systems Design Award for a uniquely modular electronics system: the "E-Box" and landed our team as quarterfinalists in the San Diego Robotics Regional Competition.  I served as the executive president that year, in charge of the overall design and construction of the robot, in addition to managing the logistical and organisational requirements of a 100-person team.</p>

                <p>Project examining the antimicrobial properties of multiple species of chrysanthemums.  I was inspired to do this project after catching the flu and being given copious amounts of chrysanthemum tea by my dad.  I wondered whether its disease-fighting properties were worth drinking 50 damned cups of the stuff a day.  I tested chrysanthemum's effect on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as compared to conventional ampecillin antibiotics.  Unfortunately, while chrysanthemum does help stave off bacteria a bit, you're probably better off chugging pills for now.  Won 2nd place in the Microbiology category at the Synopsys Science Fair.</p>

                <p>120 lb semi-autonomous robot built for FIRST Robotics competition.  Essentially used to play soccer.  Features include a custom-machined, tracked drive train capable of traversing extremely uneven terrain at high speed with no damage, utilising a pneumatically driven kicker to play the robot equivalent of soccer.  I served as the co-technical president, overseeing systems integration and doing all the computer-aided-design work for digitally constructing the robot before physically fabricating it.</p>
